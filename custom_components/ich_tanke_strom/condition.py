"""Conditions for Swiss Charging Stations.

"Favorite station is available" and "Favorite station is occupied" for the
automation editor's condition list, based on the derived site status of a
favorite (a single charge point or a whole site). As with the triggers, a
target that expands to other entities is narrowed to the favorite sensors
this integration created.

The condition platform API arrived in Home Assistant 2026.11. On an older
version the module still imports, but offers no conditions.
