"""Geo-location entities for charging sites.

Radius entries only: shows one marker per physical charging site (connectors
grouped by ChargingStationId / operator+address, same grouping as the
favorite picker) that currently matches the live filters. The marker label
carries the site's availability ("6/7 frei"), so multi-connector sites no
longer stack several indistinguishable per-connector markers on identical
coordinates. Custom lightweight management instead of an external
feed-manager package — on every coordinator update (new data OR a filter
change), the currently filtered site list is diffed against the entities
already created (new ones added, stale ones removed, surviving ones updated
in place so their label stays current).

Favorite entries (single connector or whole site) intentionally get no map
marker — the radius view already covers map display, and a favorite is
tracked via its sensors instead.
