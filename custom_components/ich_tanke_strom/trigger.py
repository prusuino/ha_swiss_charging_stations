"""Triggers for Swiss Charging Stations.

"Favorite station became available", "Favorite station became occupied"
and "Available count crossed a threshold" for the automation editor's
trigger list. The status triggers watch the derived site status of a
favorite (a single charge point or a whole site: available / occupied /
closed / out_of_service), the count trigger the available-count sensors of
a radius overview or a site. A target that expands to other entities (a
device, an area) is narrowed to the ones this integration created.

The trigger platform API arrived in Home Assistant 2026.10. On an older
version the module still imports, but offers no triggers.
